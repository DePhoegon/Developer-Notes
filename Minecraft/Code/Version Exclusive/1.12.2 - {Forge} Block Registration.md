Not Strictly the way it was done when 1.12.2 was new.
- Modernization concepts like using arrays as holders and a stream of a static final array or a foreach for nonstreaming arrays
- Use of dedicated block classes allowing for reuse and passing in of key details

```JAVA
@Mod.EventBusSubscriber  
public class ModBlocks {  
  
    public static final Block TEST_SAND = new TestSandBlock();  
    public static final Block TEST_LEAF = new leafBlock("testleaf", CreativeTabs.DECORATIONS, leafBlock.BIOME);  
  
  
    private static final Block [] BLOCKS = {  
            TEST_SAND,  
            TEST_LEAF  
    };  
    @SubscribeEvent  
    public static void registerBlocks(RegistryEvent.Register<Block> event) {  
        Arrays.stream(BLOCKS).forEach((block) -> event.getRegistry().register(block));  
    }  
  
    @SubscribeEvent  
    public static void registerItemBlocks(RegistryEvent.Register<Item> event) {  
        Arrays.stream(BLOCKS).forEach((block) -> event.getRegistry().register(new ItemBlock(block).setRegistryName(block.getRegistryName())));  
    }  
}
```
