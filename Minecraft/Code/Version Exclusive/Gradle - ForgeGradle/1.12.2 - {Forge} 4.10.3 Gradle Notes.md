# IMPORTANT
- Requires Files from 1.15.2 - 31.2.60 MDK [Downloads for Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.15.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.15.2.html)
- Requires Files from 1.12.2 - 14.23.5.2860 [Downloads for Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.12.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)
- Customized build.gradle File Required.

## Functionality
- Works on Lastest 14.23.5.2860 Forge (Via CurseForge client)

## GRADLE FOLDER
- The [[4.10.3 - {Gradle} Wrapper]] are to be used
	-  This keeps it (for now) Functional with current Intellij (2020+, running on 2025)

## SETUP
- The [[1.12.2 - {Gradle} Setup Files]] from the MDK are to be used
	- Excluding gradlewrapper files
	- Excluding build.gradle & gradle.properties
- Put the Gradle Wrapper folder over the one from the 1.12.2 MDK & replacing the 2 files
- The [[1.12.2 - {ForgeGradle} build.gradle Setup]] 
	-  Allowing for variables to be used & controlled easier in the properties file.
- The [[4.10.3 - gradle.properties]] are used for the gradle.properties file

## Folder Structure
- src/main/java/ < path identical to your Mod_group > / < MainClass, typically Mod_ID name >
- src/main/resources/
	- [[1.12.2 - {Forge}mcmod.info]]
	- [[1.12.2 - {Forge}pack.mcmeta]]

## INTELLIJ
- [[1.12.2 - {Forge}Intellij Setup]]
### Notes
- There will be a slew of undownloadable Errors (not fixable)
- Source files are 'explorable' in the same way as modern versions of modding in intellij under the external libraries
	- This is a ForgeGradle 2.3_Snapshot issue, Not worth fixing currently
